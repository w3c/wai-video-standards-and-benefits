## Audio Description {#ad}

This video does not include audio description because the visuals only support the audio and do not provide additional information. In this case, audio description would be more distracting than useful to most people, including people who cannot see the visuals. The Transcript with Description below includes descriptions of the supporting visuals.

If you want examples of videos with audio description, see [Web Accessibility Perspectives - Audio Described (YouTube playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21yWr7evHTs&list=PLhDEeYUfW02Qo4r2KlzagxZxhYcZADee-), or you can select one of the videos on the [Web Accessibility Perspectives web page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspectives/) and select "Enable Audio Description".
